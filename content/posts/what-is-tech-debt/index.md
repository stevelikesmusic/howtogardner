title: 'What Is Tech Debt'
Description: 'A tale of metaphors'
---

Technical debt seems to be a word that many people in tech know _of_, but struggle to be able to articulate what it actually is. Tech debt is choices. Choices made by leaders on where to invest. Choices by engineers in what technology they choose to use. And choices by product managers in how fast they drive the team to deliver.

Tech debt as entropy. As companies grow, so too do the systems in which they operate grow. Without constant investment and energy, entropy grows. With higher entropy and uncertainty, those increasingly complex systems are [more likely to fail](https://how.complexsystems.fail/).

High entropy vs. low entropy decisions in engineering. High entropy meaning that it will need further investment sooner. Low entropy often implying higher investment now giving a longer life of lower entropy. 

The effects of leadership decisions causing knowledge (operational and maintenance) to be siloed or lost. Early decisions to bootstrap a project or produce need. That can't be a forever decision or even one that doesn't get nurtured and developed further or replaced as the business grows. 

High entropy means that change can happen fast from the product. Quick decisions in early days mean that product can quickly pivot and re-engineer when needed. But as the business grows, those decisions can become a liability. As the business gains more customers who are paying money, stability is needed. There need to be more lower entropy decisions and more stability overall. The things that get an early stage startup off the ground are not the things that will get them to be a public company. Similarly for that company to get to the next level of growth, there needs to be a balance of high and low entropy investments. The company needs to still be able to take risks and make bets on new products, but those bets need to be made with a clear understanding of the risk and the potential impact on the business. Additionally, the company needs to lower the overall entropy of the underlying platforms that power the product experience. 

What are examples of high and low entropy. What do I mean by entropy at all??

How does tech debt manifest?
