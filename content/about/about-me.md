## Hi, I'm Steve üëã

I'm a technology leader with a passion for developing high-performing teams and innovative software products. With years of experience in the tech industry, I specialize in product development, mentoring developers, and providing technical leadership. I do this by serving as a fractional engineer for businesses looking to leverage technology effectively.

## My Story

I got my start working keys - of a saxophone. I went to school for music. After graduating with a master's degree, moved to Los Angeles to make it as a rich and famous saxophone player as we do. After a few years of freelancing, teaching, and playing in bands, I married my best friend and started thinking about family. I wanted to do something that would be more conducive to raising a family and living abroad. After doing some research, I found an article by a former DJ from San Diego that taught himself to how to code and was now making a living as a software engineer. I thought, "I can do that!" I began learning through tutorials, mini-courses, and books from the library. As I learned I'd build small projects and share them on my blog. After 14 months of learning, I landed my first job as a software engineer at Blackboard. 

### Growing Skills

I spent the next 3 years working at few different companies. Along the way I developed expertise across a variety of technologies and programming languages. I had the opportunity to develop as a full-stack engineer at Blackboard. I went deeper on Java supporting Kroger's entry into eCommerce. At Learning Without Tears, I had the opportunity to learn more about launching 0 to 1 and building an engineering team as one of the first 3 software engineers at the company. I also had my first entry into management, leading a team of 3 contract engineers. Eventually, I had the opportunity to work at a company I had been following since I began my tech journey, Zapier.

### Working Around the World

Zapier is a remote-first company, and I learned to not only work remotely, but from all over the world. Within a month of starting at Zapier, my wife and I with our 1 and 3 year, began our digital nomad journey in Santa Theresa, Costa Rica. At Zapier, I built out the new UI for Zapier's Developer Platform, allowing companies to more easily integrate their products with Zapier. It was big learning experience joining Zapier at 100 people and growing to over 500 people. I learned a lot about scaling teams, processes, and products. During this time, my family and I slow-traveled through:

- Costa Rica (Santa Teresa, Trinidad de Dota, Escazu)
- Canada (Toronto)
- New Zealand (Wellington area)
- Australia (Melbourne)
- Indio, California
- US Virgin Islands (St. Thomas)

### Growing Food Too

In 2022 we moved back to the US for two big changes. I began working at Netflix as a Senior Software Engineer and we bought a 3 acres outside of Atlanta that we developed into a small working permaculture farm. My 3 years at Netflix were a great experience. I moved across 3 different teams from enterprise software, to Privacy Engineering, and finally on the streaming side where I tackled tech-debt across the company while supporting the Edge APIs that powered 70% of Netflix's traffic.

On the farm, my wife Adina led the design and implementation of our permaculture farm. We planted over 40 fruit trees, berry bushes, and nut trees. We grew a variety of vegetables, herbs, and wild flowers. We also kept a small flock of laying hens and four Nigerian dwarf goats. I built a mobile chicken coop that where we practiced free ranging our hens. We learned a lot about growing food, permaculture, and soil development. Adina transformed solid Georgia clay into rich, loamy soil. 

## How I Work

### Product Thinking

I'm a full-stack engineer focussing on products. Although I started out in UI, I don't necessarily prefer any part of the stack over the other. For me, it's having the end-to-end context of the product to make the best decisions. I thrive having conversations about how to make the product better, and then implementing those changes wherever they are needed. I'm a life-long learner and very curious. This means I tend to ask a lot of questions. I love to learn about the business, the users, and the technology. I believe that understanding the "why" behind a product is just as important as the "how".

### Remote Work

I started working remotely off and on in 2015. Since 2018, I've been fully remote. I love the flexibility and freedom that remote work provides. I believe that remote work is the future of work, and I'm passionate about helping others succeed in this environment. I have experience working with teams across different time zones and cultures, and I understand the challenges and opportunities that come with remote work.

I also believe that a lot of the patterns that make a remote team successful can be applied to any team. Some of the strategies I've adopted include:

- **Asynchronous Communication**: I prioritize async communication to ensure that everyone has the opportunity to contribute, regardless of their time zone. I never assume that someones working hours are the same as mine. 
- **Documentation**: I believe that documentation is key to successful remote work. I document everything. This ensures that everyone is on the same page and can refer back to important information when needed. For me personally, it suits my learning style. I learn best when I write things down. This helps me to gather feedback and broadly share context.
- **Transparency**: I believe in being transparent about my work and the work of my team. This helps to build trust and accountability, and ensures that everyone is aligned on our goals and priorities. Building trust is crucial to 

All of this is to build trust. I believe that trust is the foundation of any successful team, and I work hard to build and maintain that trust with my colleagues. 

### Mentoring

I've been passionate about mentoring and education since I was a musician teaching saxophone lessons. I love helping others grow and develop their skills. I've had the opportunity to mentor many developers, both formally and informally, and I find it incredibly rewarding. I find opportunities to mentor in every role I've had. This includes 1:1 mentoring as well as group presentations. I love to share my knowledge and experience with others, and I'm always looking for ways to help others grow. A couple friends started a non-profit called The Collab Lab, that I helped with in its first few years. While it existed, we coached cohorts of early career engineers coming from non-traditional backgrounds in working on a remote team.
