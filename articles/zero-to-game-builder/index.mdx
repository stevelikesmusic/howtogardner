My children, Sky and August, have big dreams. They’re 8 and 10, and for the longest time,
they’ve begged me to build video games with them. Not just any old video games—games with immersive worlds, roaming animals, and characters that obey the laws of physics.

For me, this was a tall order. I’m an accomplished software engineer, but I haven’t mastered game-building. The best I came up with was a flappy-bird-like game we called [Bird Bounce](https://stevelikesmusic.github.io/gamers/bird-bounce/). That was fun
to build with them, but it didn’t do a whole lot. It was flat and static and it failed to fulfil my kids’ big imaginations.

I tried to explain how difficult their creative dreams were.

_“What will it take?”_ they asked.

In my mind, I envisioned years of computer science courses, endless practicing and networking.

_“A lot...”_ I answered.

Fast forward to this year (summer 2025) and it occurred to me—what if we used the current
generation of AI coding agents to vibe code?

We tried this approach and what a difference it has made! AI is like rocket fuel pushing my kids’ creativity into outer space. (I share their game progress at the end of this article!)

At this point, the kids are obsessed with bringing their ideas to life, and I am too. If you, like me, want to help you kids build a working game, then come with me. I’ll take you through our building process, from idea to working 3D interactive game.

One piece of context to know is this: my kids have been learning programming for the last year and half.

They use:

- Scratch with [Lego Education](https://education.lego.com/en-us/)
- [Code Kingdoms](https://codekingdoms.com/), a scratch-like Java interface to build Minecraft mods.

By using AI, we're optimizing for different skills than programming alone. We’re focused on building and thinking through ideas rather than learning specific programming skills.

## Tech Stack

The web platform is not the most popular or powerful tool for building games, but that’s what we use. That’s right—we build 3D games with just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My reasoning: the artificial intelligence (AI)—or large language models (LLMs)—we use is trained on an immense set of web platform examples. There are far fewer examples—relatively speaking—for game-specific platforms like [Unity](https://unity.com/), [Unreal](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US), or [Godot](https://godotengine.org/).

Using HTML, CSS and Javascript to build games with AI is like speaking Spanish in Spain. It just makes sense.

### Three.js

With JavaScript, we specifically use [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) to handle our graphics rendering. Three.js has a huge community, and again, plenty of examples for LLMs to leverage for training.

### Claude

We've found the most success with Anthropic's [Claude](https://www.anthropic.com/claude) and [Claude Code](https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code). You may find other LLMs and tools work better for you. The ideas shared here should work for any LLM agent coding tool.

### Vite

We initially started with no bundling—keeping it simple and bare. This turned out to be a bit of a pain with things like restarting our dev server with each change. [Vite](https://vite.dev/) is a super simple dev server that gave us everything we needed to easily develop and serve the game.

### GitHub Pages

There a plenty of platforms to serve your game from. Since we push all our code to GitHub, and this is a simple build, it just made sense to host the game with GitHub Pages. It's very easy to [setup a GitHub Action](https://vite.dev/guide/static-deploy.html#github-pages) to deploy your game. It's also exciting for the kids when they can share their game with friends and family.

## Start with an Idea

When we begin building a game, the first step is simple. I ask the kids to describe their idea. I encourage them to describe as much detail as possible. As they're talking, I'm typing into Claude to capture all their game context. My goal at this point is to get a detailed specification on what they imagine their game to be. You'll need to ask plenty of follow-up questions.

With Skylar (the 8-year old) for example:

- _What does the character look like?_ "A tiger"
- _How do we see the tiger, facing towards us or away?_ "From behind"
- _Are there other characters in the game the tiger sees?_ "Yes, prey and other predators"
- _How does your character move and interact with the world?_ "It hunts and escapes attacks from leopards"

Skylar wanted to design a tiger survival simulator. She wanted to control the tiger as it navigated the jungle. The tiger would explore, hunt, and survive other predators.

Besides the game details, she added some important context which she incorporated into her prompts:

- This is a 3D game
- Use Three.js
- Create a specification for this game

I reminded her to be specific with what she wanted. She should even tell Claude to ask clarifying questions. The LLM needs plenty of context to get as close to your child's vision as possible.

### It's All in the Details

Why did we start with Claude to create a specification document rather than jumping right into coding? Because of a theme I'll continually revisit in this series—LLMs work best with focused context.

My children and I experimented with giving Claude Code a long prose-y list of requirements. The LLM ended up making lots of independent decisions and giving us unexpected results. This was sub-optimal.

My kids learned a huge lesson: take time to plan before tasking the LLM to do the work. This not only lets them envision and direct what the LLM will do, but it hones their critical thinking.

After crafting new commands, the kids reviewed the output from the spec. This was a huge
learning opportunity. They had the chance to see what assumptions Claude made based on the context they provided. They also saw what Claude left out. This allowed them to clarify their requirements and also add details they had forgotten.

## Use the Spec

Once the kids were satisfied with the spec, it was time to set up their project with Claude. I chose a basic Vite setup to provide a decent developer experience. The base project started as a plain Vite app and some markdown files to help Claude navigate the project. The easiest way to create a new Vite project is: `npm create vite@latest`.

- [claude.md](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-code-best-practices#a-create-files) - This file is loaded by Claude Code at the start of a session. We use it to tell Claude how to develop in the repo (more on that later), tools that it can use, where important context documents are and a high level overview of the project. Keep this document to around 100 lines or less. When it’s too long, the LLM loses continuity, as it gets preprended to each prompt.

- .claude/ - This directory is used to group context for Claude. I keep the game spec in this folder as well as other progress and planning documents we end up creating.

### Plan the Plan

Finally, it was time to use Claude Code. The first thing I do is set the stage for my young vibe coders. I tell August, my 10 year old, to instruct Claude Code to create a phased plan that implements our game spec. Claude should be in planning mode for this. Place Claude in planning mode by pressing “Shift” + “Tab.”

We've found that if the game is complex and requires more research, it's helpful to have Claude use multiple agents. You can instruct Claude to use multiple agents by adding the phrase “and use multiple agents” at the end of a command. This allows the Claude LLM to conduct multiple streams of research in parallel.

At this point, the kids and I learned to instruct Claude to think deeply—as in, "Think deeply about the best design decisions for this spec. Use multiple agents if you find different streams of research".

Once Claude has thought about its plan, it will let you know it's done and ask to implement the plan.

Pause. Don’t simply say yes!

You need Claude to document this plan. If Claude doesn’t document the plan, then it may lose context over time. I put it in the following file: .claude/progress.md to track the development progress across sessions.

## Execute the Plan

Finally! We had an iterative plan based on the spec. We could begin coding our amazing game with Claude Code.

But first—we cleared the context window. Any time you start a phase or a large chunk of work in an LLM, you want to clear the context window—also called clearing the session. Claude can handle a lot of context, but each subsequent prompt in a session adds to the context window which in turn, [increases your risk](https://towardsdatascience.com/your-1m-context-window-llm-is-less-powerful-than-you-think/#:~:text=of%20working%20memory?-,What%20happens%20if%20we%20exceed%20an%20LLM's%20working%20memory?,in%20its%20limited%20working%20memory.) of unexpected results. Use `/clear` to give Claude a fresh start. Then ask it to start on the next phase. Your `claude.md` file should point to all the context Claude needs to understand what phase is next and what the scope of the project is.

Now we were off to the races! Claude picked up the next chunk of work and started building. At times, we got to a point where Claude was having a hard time “visualizing” what one of my children was describing. In this case, a picture can help.

One example: when Skylar got frustrated with the terrain Claude produced, she found a picture of a 3D jungle. She gave that picture to Claude (simply drag it into the terminal), and Claude built a satisfactory jungle in which her tiger could roam.

In the early stages, all we had was an orange rectangle on a flat black plane. But to my delight, my daughter iteratively developed this flat ordinary plane into one of her favorite 3D games. If you have children, maybe you’re thinking:

> Sure, Steve. An 8 year old is strictly using issue tracking and following planned work?

Nope. She is not. The progress document is a way to keep track of all the things should we run out of ideas—but we rarely run out of ideas. But the process for starting new/unplanned work is the same:

1. Go into Claude Code with plan mode
2. Outline her goal for the next feature
3. Trigger Claude to write a document that we can visit in future sessions

One important thing to call out is commit your changes and commit often—we learned that the hard way! Forgetting to commit caused a lot more headache in a single session than was necessary. And we were doing this all on the main branch. At some point, Claude suddenly introduced a gnarly regression. Claude's first answer was to reset back to the latest commit—which would have lost all of our progress. So we went back through the loooooong process of unwinding the changes and using console messages to get the game back into a stable state.

We were lucky. I have a line in our claude.md workflow to create a new branch when starting a session and to commit changes each time it completes a task from its to-dos. When Claude forgets, I make sure to commit changes so we can always reset back to a working state—and `main` is kept in good working order.

One example of going off-script to our "plan" occurred when Skylar wanted to add an ambush feature where crocodiles launch out of water and attack the tiger. We stuck to our method and got it working in no time—although she jumped off her seat the first time a crocodile ambushed her tiger.

## Debugging

I added the playwright MCP server to help with testing, but it was less helpful for games. Claude only makes short taps on the keys, as it's optimized for screen shots—though the playwright MCP is a fantastic tool for developing a web app.

When things just aren't working, manual testing works best for me. Claude will add logging to the suspected areas of the code. Then we simply copy the logs back into the terminal. While a human has a hard time parsing thousands of lines of logging, Claude has no trouble. Just be sure to clean the logging up afterwards, as it can sometimes be a pain to find what you're looking for. Claude sometimes adds quite a bit of noise.

If Claude doesn't produce the results Skylar wants, she starts typing out what she expects as a numbered list. One example:

1. Crocs should hide until they notice their prey
2. Crocs should lunge attack
3. They should pull the tiger in and then let go after 5 seconds

## Have Patience

Part of vibe coding with your kids is just having fun with them. Let their imaginations go wild—there's hardly any barrier between what they think of and what they can build. I had one case where I was sure I could quickly debug a problem. Skylar insisted she wanted to continue directing Claude to fix it and...she was right.

It's been a blast to see her little mind go. My son and daughter have both picked up on when to prompt Claude to think about a problem and how to use multiple agents judiciously. One night, they blew through all our Claude usage in one go researching the initial ambush system with 4 agents.

## Key Takeways

I was sold on agent assisted coding, but Claude Code blew me away with what it could do in the hands of a child. Some things to remember if you want to code with your kids:

1. Your child's imagination is huge. Optimize for their curiosity and expression. For me, the temptation (as a professional...) is to be rigid and think we have to build in a "certain way". I’ve discovered I can give the minimal amount of structure for them to successfully build with Claude. Children are fantastic learners.
2. Plan your session. Part of that minimal structure is giving Claude the faintest hint of a framework to go off of. It also keeps your child focussed on their goal.
3. As you finish a task, use `/clear` to give you a clean context window to work with.
4. Use numbered lists when prompting Claude. This helps both clear your child's thinking and order Claude's approach.
5. Commit. Your. Changes. Always be committing stable code.
6. Remember to use pictures. Claude can do _a lot_ with an image of what you're going for.

## What's Next

We're still building [Tiger Evolution 3D](https://stevelikesmusic.github.io/tiger-evolution-3d/) with lots of plans for future iterations. The biggest one will be integrating a rigged 3D model with animations into the game. This will take the game up a notch. But for now, she's quite satisfied with her striped orange block prowling throughout the jungle.

## Final Thoughts

What started as a way to finally fulfill my kids' game-building dreams turned into some of our favorite time together. Seeing Skylar debug a crocodile attack or August work through how to get the physics right in his 2D sandbox game has been so much fun for us.

The real magic isn't in the games we build—it's in watching them realize that the gap between imagination and reality is smaller than they thought. Your kids' first games won't be perfect, and that's exactly the point. The games will be theirs. And in a world where AI is becoming ubiquitous, there's something powerful about teaching kids to creatively use these tools.

If you try this approach, I'd love to hear how it goes. Feel free to share your kids' games—we're always looking for inspiration for our next project!

### One More Thing

We also have been using Claude artifacts to create interactive demos of concepts we're learning like electricity and magnetism. We explore what the kids want to know about a concept, do a little research, then code those concepts into science games.

It's so simple, a child can do it.
