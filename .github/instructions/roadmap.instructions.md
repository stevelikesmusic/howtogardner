3. [ ] Update MailerLite (manually in their UI) to use a more personalized template for email confirmations
4. [ ] Add logging/observability/analytics to the website (look at overreacted.io)
5. [ ] Add some DX tools like husky and lint-staged with prettier
6. [ ] Fine tune eslint lint rules
7. [ ] Use tailwind config for themes and common values
