# Roadmap for Personal Website and Blog

[ ] Internationalize the website for Dates and Times
[ ] Use a configuration for common values like CTAs, site title, name, and email
[ ] Update MailerLite (manually in their UI) to use a more personalized template for email confirmations
[ ] Add logging/observability/analytics to the website (look at overreacted.io)
[ ] Add some DX tools like husky and lint-staged with prettier
[ ] Fine tune eslint lint rules
