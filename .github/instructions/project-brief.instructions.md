This is a personal website and blog.

The code should be well abstracted into reusable components, with a focus on simplicity and maintainability.

As you work, you should document the progress of your work plan in ()[.github/instructions/progress.instructions.md]. This will help you keep track of what you've done and what still needs to be done. Use MD checkboxes to indicate completed tasks.

As you add additional tools or libraries, please document them in the same progress file. This will help you keep track of your dependencies and ensure that your code is easy to maintain.
