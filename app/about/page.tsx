            <p>
              Iâ€™m an engineering leader who believes the most effective way to
              build influence is to be of genuine service to your colleagues.
              Over the past decade at companies like Netflix and Zapier, Iâ€™ve
              learned that complex engineering problems arenâ€™t just
              technicalâ€”they require empathy, adaptability, and the willingness
              to take on whatever role helps most. As a fractional CTO, I help
              growing companies ship faster with fewer outages by deeply
              understanding their challenges and working alongside teams to
              solve them, rather than mandating generic solutions.
