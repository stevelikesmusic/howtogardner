            <p>
              Iâ€™m a technology leader with a passion for developing
              high-performing teams and innovative software products. With years
              of experience in high profile tech companies, and success in high
              impact roles, I specialize in product development, engineer
              mentoring, and technical leadership. I do this with the
              understanding that true leadership is service. I also provide
              fractional engineering to businesses seeking to leverage
              technology effectively.
